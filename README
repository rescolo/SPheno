input files specified above, denoted by SPheno.out.xxx and
SPheno.spc.xxx, where xxx stands for any of the models above in the
directory SPheno3.beta/input.

II) Installation:
   1) Please adopt the Makefile according to your f90/f95 compiler. The 
      Makefile is written for the NAC f95 compiler.
      On alpha machines, the compiler stops sometimes giving as reason 
      too small memory. In this case change the "-O" option to "-g" which
      worked up to now in all known cases.
   2) Run gmake.
      This will compile the SPheno and run it once. The output will
      be written to two files:
      - SPheno.out containg all information about masses, mixing matrices,
        decay widths, branching ratios and production cross sections.
        The numbers should be identical to the ones given in the file
        SPheno.out.mSugra provided you did not change the file 
        Highscale.in
      - Messages.out containing warnings and error messages and it should
        be empty.
   3) The library libSPheno.a is stored in the subdirectory lib.

III) Running the program for different high scale models
 The easiest way is to copy the corresponding Highscale.in.xxx file to
 Highscale.in (xxx stands for the model considered, see above) and change the
 numbers according to your needs. Various models for Highscale.in.xxx are
 in the subdirectory code. 

IV) The manuals can be obtained from: 
  http://theorie.physik.uni-wuerzburg/~porod/doc/SPheno.ps
  http://theorie.physik.uni-wuerzburg/~porod/doc/SPheno3.ps

V) In case of problems: please send an email to porod@physik.unizh.ch
explaining the problem. Useful informations is in general contained in
the file Messages.out; moreover, you should provide me with the input files
used so that I can try to repeat the run and to decect the source of the 
problem.

Have fun,

Werner Porod

History:
12.01.08: including now low energy versions of the NMSSM and bilinear
          R-parity breaking 
22.12.07: including a restricted version of SLHA2, see SPheno3.ps
          for details
24.07.06: bug in the calculation of b->s gamma: the order of the u-squark masses did not correspond to
          the order of the eigenvectors (thanks to Sasha Belyaev)
11.05.06: adding a missing exit statement after the warning for numerical problems in the
          calculation of mu in LoopMassesMSSM (thanks to Frank Meisel)
23.03.06: correcting two bugs in the (g-2)_muon routine, which nearly canceled each other
          except for special parameter combinations.
          giving now a_mu in the output instead of (g-2)_muon 
21.02.06: giving now complete rho-parameter instead of the 3rd generation
          sfermion contribution
10.02.06: correcting F-term contributions due to the sneutrino-slepton quartic
          coupling
09.01.06: there have been still a few calls in the routine NeutralinoThreeBodyDecays
          where the total width of intermediate states have been non-zero indpendent
          if the flag check required them to be zero. Fixed now. 
16.09.05: replacing stop statements by 'Call TerminateProgram' to make
          debugging easier
02.09.05: - bug in the calculation of the H+ H- cross section due to incorrect
            setting of sinW2 in the H+ H- z coupling
22.08.05: correcting normalization in the routine RunningCouplings [in
          module LoopCouplings]. This effects the cross sections for
          squarks, smuons, staus and H+.
27.07.05: correcting bug in the 1-loop 4-point function D27, effects
          slightly the calculation of sin^2(theta^DR_W)
30.05.05: fixing a bug in the Les Houches input for the general MSSM, which
          was caused by an incorrect call to the error message system. 
          In addition the Yukawas had not been calculated correctly. (thanks
          to Huber Nieto)
20.03.05: correcting a bug in LesHouches_Input: in case of comment between
          input lines, the loop was left without reading the remaining data
18.04.05: start to reorder the storage of public variables + directories
          in view of planned extensions. As a first step there are four
          pre-defined scales for the MSSM parameters: mZ, Q_EWSB, m_nu_R
          and scale of the high scale model, see module MSSM_data 
11.02.04: correcting bug in 2-loop part of A_u and M^2_Q (thanks to Juergen Reuter)
20.12.04: fixing bug in the calculation of m_tau^DR(mZ) and m_b^DR(mZ) where the
          U(1) coupling already in the GUT normalization had been used instead
          the usual hypercharge. Numerical effects are small except for very
          large tan(beta)
10.12.04: fixing a bug in the calculation of the sin^2(theta_W^DR)
05.10.04: fixing bug for e+ e- -> Z h, Z H
12.09.04: improving the numerical accuracy in the routine LoopMasses
          by checking that also the DR vev changes less then required
          precision
07.09.04: improving check for on-shell states in 3-body decays

          several energies and/or polarisation combinations

          'off-diagonal' cross sections for sfermions and charginos have only
          been calculated for one combination. This was o.k. for unpolarized
          beams but for polarized beams this is implies missing information.
          This also implied a small modification of the routine WriteCrossSection
          in module InputOutput
15.06.04: there seems to be a bug in the QCD corrections of H->q \bar{q}
          (thanks to M. Hirsch for pointing this out). Using therefore
          the approximate formula for the moment
30.05.04: improving the calculation of the on-shell masses in module LoopMasses
          by putting loops which depend on the required preicsion instead of
          a second iteration. This concerns the outer momentum dependence of
          the self energies.

          using 4-loop RGEs for the evolution up to m_Z
05.12.03: - calculation of Yukawas at m_Z is now done using running masses
            at m_Z
          - changing slightly the calculation of the running masses
24.11.03: including decay neutralino_j -> neutralino_i photon
07.11.03: adding general MSSM to allow for computation of branching ratios
          and cross sections if 'only' low energy parameters are provided

          the routines provided Pietro Slavich (has been reported by him)
16.09.03: Merging output for 2- body and 3-body decay modes in in common arrays
          This simplifies life for the Les Houches output
25.08.03: - bug fix in a few couplings for the process

03.07.03: Stop contribution to b->s gamma contained bug, changes to
          the branching ratio up to 30\%.
04.06.03: The file EplusEminusProduction.f90 contained some F90 extensions.
